Version 2.2.0
-------------

This update is **HUGE**!  
So instead of the typical list I'll try to summarize the biggest changes first and then I'll list everything in detail.  
Also, please be aware that with this update support for version 2.1.6 stops right now. If you need my help, update.

### Huge Changes

\+ Using new HOCON config instead of YAML. Your old config will be migrated and backuped. The new format includes lots of helpful comments, is a lot less prone
   to incorrect formatting (you don't need to worry about indentation, `:` and `=` are interchangeable, etc.) and the config formats itself.  
\+ New translation system. This includes default translations that are shipped with the plugin, customizable translations, custom languages and few quality of
   life changes compared to the old system. **Be sure to read the README files when editing translations!**  
\* Reworked the channel system. Local chat now is treated the exact same way as global chat in the sense that it has its own command and permissions.  
\* Fixed several issues with people relogging too quickly.  

### Full Changelog

\+ Added contributors and donators to the startup banner.  
\+ Using new HOCON config instead of YAML. (New config file is called `config.conf`) (Features of HOCON:
   https://github.com/typesafehub/config#using-hocon-the-json-superset)  
\+ New message translation system with default translation files.  
\+ Added several new placeholders:  
  - `%fulldisplayname%`, `%sender_fulldisplayname%`, `%target_fulldisplayname%`
  - `%to_servername%`, `%to_serveralias%`, `%to_serverip%` (for ServerSwitch Messages)
  - `%from_servername%`, `%from_serveralias%`, `%from_serverip%` (for ServerSwitch Messages)

\+ Added `/local` command.  
\+ Added `/localto` command.  
\+ Added MulticastChat to group local servers together.  
\+ Added `on`/`off` parameters for `/bvanish`.  
\+ Added `de_DE`, `fr_FR`, `hu_HU`, `nl_NL`, `pl_PL`, `ru_RU`, `zh_CN` translations (done by their respective translators). If you can update them or add a new
   language, feel free to [open a Pull Request on GitHub](https://github.com/AuraDevelopmentTeam/BungeeChat2/compare).  
\+ Added support for CloudNet Permissions Systems.  
\+ Added more options for passing local chat through the Bungee.
